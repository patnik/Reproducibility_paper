# Reproducibility jounral article - Exploring long-term youth unemployment in Europe using sequence analysis: a reproducible notebook approach

## Summary
This page inlcudes the code for my work that highlights the importance of using reproducible pipelines in academic articles. This work focuses on long-term unemployment
in Europe, but it also inlcudes the code that someone can use to reproduce the results. Morever, the code can be used by other people that wish to perform similar
analysis.

## Abstract
Youth unemployment is a factor influencing European policy. The effects of financial crisis of 2008 in youth unemployment were prominent and varied across European countries and regions. This notebook aims to identify key representative trajectories of youth unemployment by NUTS 2 regions in Europe from 2008 to 2018. Moreover, this notebook provides a self-contained research workflow that is fully reproducible and transparent, using a wide range of functionalities offered by computational notebooks. The results show that there is a divide between northern and southern regions. Northern regions follow stable low youth unemployment levels, while southern regions follow stable high youth unemployment levels. Finally, the results show that there are patterns of regional inequalities between major metropolitan areas and their adjacent regions.
